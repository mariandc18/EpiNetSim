# EcoNetSim
This simulator utilizes various epidemiological models, including SEIR, SIS, SIR, and others. It is based on the analysis of complex networks and investigates how the behavior of an epidemic changes when the network is subjected to different perturbations, such as vaccination, node disconnection, quarantine measures, and more.
